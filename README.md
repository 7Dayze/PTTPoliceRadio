# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for your voice application is pushed and is restricted to LEO's only.
<br><br>
*Your voice application must have a PTT button mapped to LEFT ALT or you can modify the script to change the key.*
<br>
# Controls
**LEFT ALT - Talk on radio.**
<br>
*When aiming a weapon, player must release the aim button (RIGHT MOUSE) when activiating LEFT ALT (and vice versa). Otherwise the animation will not play properly.*
<br><br>
**Z - Hold gun holster.**
# Extras
Included are the 2 mic click sound effects I use on Teamspeak.
