# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for your voice application is pushed.
###### _Your voice application must have a PTT button mapped to LEFT ALT or you can modify the script to change the key._
A very special thank you to IllusiveTea for assisting with this script.
## Controls
###### _Restricted to LEO's only or other peds specified._
#### **LEFT ALT - Talk on radio.**
*When aiming a weapon, player must release INPUT_AIM when activiating LEFT ALT and vice versa. Otherwise the animation will not play properly.*
#### **Z - Hold gun holster.**
#### **6 - Unholster pistol.**
#### **1 - Holster pistol.**
_When INPUT_SELECT_WEAPON_HANDGUN (6) is pressed the player will equip a pistol, removing it from their holster. When INPUT_SELECT_WEAPON_UNARMED (1) is pressed the player will return to being unarmed with the pistol back in its holster. **Using the weapon wheel has no effect.**_
## Extras
Included are the 2 mic click sound effects I use on Teamspeak.
