# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for your voice application is pushed.
###### _Your voice application must have a PTT button mapped to LEFT ALT or you can modify the script to change the key._
A very special thank you to IllusiveTea for helping write this script.
## Controls
###### _Restricted to LEO's only or other peds specified._
#### **INPUT_CHARACTER_WHEEL - Talk on radio animation. (Left ALT by default)**
*When aiming a weapon, player must release INPUT_AIM when activiating LEFT ALT and vice versa. Otherwise the animation will not play properly.*

## Extras
When the Pistol is selected it will be removed from the weapon holster and vice versa.
