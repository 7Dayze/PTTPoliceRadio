# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for your voice application is pushed and is restricted to LEO's only.
<br><br>
A very special thank you to IllusiveTea for assisting with this script.
###### _Your voice application must have a PTT button mapped to LEFT ALT or you can modify the script to change the key._
## Controls
#### **LEFT ALT - Talk on radio.**
*When aiming a weapon, player must release the aim button (RIGHT MOUSE) when activiating LEFT ALT and vice versa. Otherwise the animation will not play properly.*
#### **Z - Hold gun holster.**
## Planned Features
The ability to show the pistol out of the holster if the player is holding a pistol and vice versa.
## Extras
Included are the 2 mic click sound effects I use on Teamspeak.
