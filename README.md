# PTTPoliceRadio
Plays the police radio animation when the PTT key for Teamspeak or Discord is pushed.

*Teamspeak or Discord must have their PTT button mapped to LEFT ALT.*

# Issues
Player cannot sprint or aim a weapon when this animation is active. Unfortunately, there is no workaround for this.
