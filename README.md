# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for Teamspeak or Discord is pushed.
<br><br>
*Teamspeak or Discord must have their PTT button mapped to LEFT ALT or you can modify the script to change the key.*

# Known Issues
Player cannot aim a weapon when this animation is active. Unfortunately, there is no workaround for this.
# Extras
Included are the 2 sound effects I use on Teamspeak for my mic clicks.
