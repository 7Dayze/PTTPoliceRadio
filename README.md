# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key(s) for Teamspeak or Discord are pushed.
<br><br>
*Teamspeak or Discord must have 2 PTT buttons mapped to LEFT ALT and LEFT CTRL or you can modify the script to change the keys.*
<br>
# Controls
LEFT ALT - Talk on radio. (Player cannot aim a weapon when this animation is active.)
<br>
LEFT CTRL - Talk on radio with weapon aimed. (Player must switch between AIM (RIGHT MOUSE) and LEFT CTRL or the animation will not play properly. Both buttons cannot be pressed at once.)
# Extras
Included are the 2 sound effects I use on Teamspeak for my mic clicks.
