# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for your voice application is pushed.
<br>
A very special thank you to IllusiveTea for helping write this script.
## Controls
###### _Restricted to LEO's only or other peds specified._
#### **Talk on radio animation:**
###### Your voice application must have a PTT button mapped to this control.
`INPUT_CHARACTER_WHEEL (Left ALT by default)`
<br><br>
When aiming a weapon, player must release aim when activiating Left ALT and vice versa. Otherwise the animation will not play properly.
#### **Hold weapon holster animation:**
`INPUT_MULTIPLAYER_INFO (Z by default)`
#### **Holster/Unholster Pistol:**
When the Pistol is selected it will be removed from the weapon holster and vice versa.
## Optional Extras
Included are the 2 mic click sound effects I use on Teamspeak for my mic clicks. This gives a nice “police radio” sound to go along with the animations. I also highly recommend the Radio FX plugin.
