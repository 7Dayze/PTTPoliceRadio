# PTTPoliceRadio
This script toggles the police radio animation when the PTT key for your voice application is pushed.
<br>
A very special thank you to IllusiveTea for helping write this script.
## Controls
###### _Restricted to LEO's only or other peds specified._
#### **Talk on radio animation:**
###### _Your voice application must have a PTT button mapped to this control.
`INPUT_CHARACTER_WHEEL (Left ALT by default)`
<br>
When aiming a weapon, player must release aim when activiating Left ALT and vice versa. Otherwise the animation will not play properly.

When the Pistol is selected it will be removed from the weapon holster and vice versa.
<br>
Included are the 2 mic click sound effects I use on Teamspeak.
